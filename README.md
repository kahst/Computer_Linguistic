# Computer Linguistic Tools in Humanoid Writing and Fake News Detection
This is a collection of links and demos as part of my workshop at the 'Digital English World-Wide: Corpus and Discourse Analyses' conference in Chemnitz.

I will keep this list updated in the future - feel free to suggest more interesting resources in the issues tracker.

## Word embeddings

Word embeddings are frequently used to represent words as inputs to machine learning. The words become vectors in a multi-dimensional space, where nearby vectors represent similar meanings. With word embeddings, you can compare words by (roughly) what they mean, not just exact string matches.
