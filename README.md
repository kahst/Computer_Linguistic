# Computer Linguistic Tools in Humanoid Writing and Fake News Detection
This is a collection of links and demos as part of my workshop at the 'Digital English World-Wide: Corpus and Discourse Analyses' conference in Chemnitz.

I will keep this list updated in the future - feel free to suggest more interesting resources in the issues tracker.

## Word embeddings

Word embeddings are frequently used to represent words as inputs to machine learning. The words become vectors in a multi-dimensional space, where nearby vectors represent similar meanings. With word embeddings, you can compare words by (roughly) what they mean, not just exact string matches.

## AI text generation

Recurrent nets are a type of artificial neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as text, genomes, handwriting, the spoken word, or numerical times series data emanating from sensors, stock markets and government agencies. These algorithms take time and sequence into account, they have a temporal dimension.

## Text-to-Speech

Speech synthesis is the artificial production of human speech. A text-to-speech (TTS) system converts normal language text into speech.
